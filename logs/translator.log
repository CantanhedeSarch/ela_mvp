O Último Episódio retrata a trajetória de amadurecimento de três adolescentes da periferia, a partir de narrativas criadas sobre o fim da animação Caverna do Dragão. A obra gera reconhecimento e identificação, algo que já é marca da produtora de Contagem (MG). Por isso, como aposta o diretor do filme, Maurílio Martins, deve emocionar a todos os públicos.  É um filme que retrata um momento muito específico do mundo, no qual a comunicação era distinta e passávamos por uma crise econômica que as novas gerações não entendem, mas as dores são iguais às de hoje. As dores do crescimento são iguais em qualquer lugar do mundo. Por isso, a identificação é muito imediata, tanto para quem está vivendo, quanto para quem já viveu essas situações, explica, em entrevista ao Conversa Bem Viver. O enredo parte da história criada por um dos adolescentes, que, com o objetivo de conquistar uma colega de escola, diz que tem uma fita com o último episódio do desenho que marcou as gerações dos anos 80 e 90. Mas, no desenrolar da narrativa, vão ficando claros os dilemas enfrentados pelos jovens. A busca por um novo amor, dificuldades financeiras familiares e ausência parental são alguns deles.  Tudo isso mantendo características fiéis da Filmes de Plástico, como o olhar cuidadoso ao cotidiano, a representação de pessoas negras sem estereotipá-las e a sensibilidade que gera intimismo. Como os nossos filmes partem da sinceridade e de um olhar muito profundo sobre o nosso cotidiano, automaticamente, esses personagens e essa geografia saltam para frente das telas. O triste é saber que isso não existe com tanta frequência nos outros lugares. Mas, de nossa parte, não é um panfleto. É natural. A Filmes de Plástico parte do princípio da sinceridade sobre aquilo que nos rodeia, enfatiza Martins.  A produtora, que comemora os seus 16 anos de história, conta também com André Novais Oliveira, Gabriel Martins e Thiago Macedo Correia. Além dos dois primeiros, o elenco de O Último Episódio tem a participação de Matheus Sampaio, Rejane Faria e Babi Amaral. A distribuição é da Malute e da Embaúba Filmes.'
